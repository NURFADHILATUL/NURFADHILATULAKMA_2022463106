<h2> SEKOLAH KEBANGSAAN KERATONG 2 </h2>
<br>
<p class="p1">SK (Felda) Keratong 2 located at Felda Keratong 2, No1, Jalan Melor, Bandar Tun Razak, Pahang. It was a public school. Starting elementary school was a mix of nervousness and fear. I remember my first day vividly.  I was afraid of the unfamiliar environment. I stayed with my grandparents since I was in kindergarten in our hometown. My father and mother lived in Selangor then with my siblings.  In year 2, I got the application letter to become a prefect in preparation for year 3. It was a new experience since I never got the opportunity like that. I learn how to become a responsible person through the job of prefect. I also have many friends in this school. I stayed in this school until year 4 because in year 5 I changed schools to live with my parents.</p>

<h3> SEKOLAH KEBANGSAAN TAMAN SERI GOMBAK 2 </h3>
<br>
<p class="p1"> SK Taman Seri Gombak 2 located at Jalan Sg 1/1 Taman Seri Gombak, Batu Caves, Selangor. It was the last elementary school I studied before entering secondary school. I continue my study in year 5 and graduate in year 6 in this school. The decision to change schools during elementary school comes as a surprise. I make the decision to change schools at that time, I got a message from my father if I wanted to change schools and I just said Yes as an answer. In this school, it was overwhelming. It was filled with unfamiliar faces and I was just 11 years old at that time. It was a struggle to get along with my other classmates, however, as time passed I became quite adept with my surroundings. Furthermore, I got an offer to become Pembimbang Rakan Sebaya. I graduated with 2A's in UPSR and got first place in class. It was a happy moment for me.</p>

<h4> SEKOLAH MENENGAH KEBANGSAAN HILLCREST </h4>
<br>
<p class="p1">SMK Hillcrest is a public school situated in Taman Seri Gombak.It was the first secondary school I went to. I started my form 1 in this school. Some of my elementary school went to this school too. The orientation sessions there helped me get familiar with the schoolâ€™s layout, rules, and schedule. I realized that, in this school student are organized through their UPSR result. Thus, I was placed in the upper classes. I got separated from my friends as they went to the other class. Studying in this class was a bit challenging because my new classmates were smarter and more creative. Besides the challenge, it was kind of fun learning new things with them and I also got a new friend. In SMK Hillcrest, I involved myself in Pembimbing Rakan Sebaya because in year 6 I already had the experience. I also went to various activities the school provided. However, at the end of Form 1, my family needed to move because my father got a new house in Putrajaya so my siblings and I needed to move schools too. </p>

<h5> SEKOLAH MENENGAH KEBANGSAAN PRESINT 18 (1) </h5>
<br>
<p class="p1"> SMKPP 18(1) was located at Putrajaya, Jalan Presint 18 (1). This school was the last school I went to before graduation. I went to PLB (aka Presint Lapan Belas, we always call this school by this nickname) in 2018, I was in form 2 at that time. Everything went smoothly with transferring to school. PLB was the most enjoyable and the best school ever. I have some mesmerizing memories as I studied and socialized there. The teachers in this school are also kind and they become a great help to me either in my academic or co-curriculum. Nevertheless, my results improved with their help and I got 4A's in Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM). I know for some people my result doesn't mean much but I am proud of myself because my hard work paid off.</p>

<h6> UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MARA </h6>
<br>
<p class="p1"> UiTM was my dream fantasy when I was a young kid. It was like a dream come true. Studying at UiTM has exposed the struggles of university student as the assignments become complicated in their way. As for the subjects that I took, some subjects are difficult because they require a lot of practice and understanding. However, it was still fun. There were a lot of activities in which the students could get to know many people and relieve their stress. I study at UiTM Merbok, Sungai Petani in the state of Kedah. I studied Library Informatics that have 5 semesters in total for diploma students. Besides Kedah was far away, and it was kind of difficult to live in another people's state because of the different taste of food and the holiday that was on Friday and Saturday. It's weird actually for people who never visited the north state before to suddenly experience it. As time passed, I felt adapted to it, however, there are some times it feels nostalgic especially if I call my mom on Friday, I always forget there are still working right there.</p>
